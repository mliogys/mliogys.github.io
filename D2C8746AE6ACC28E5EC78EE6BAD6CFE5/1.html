	Object-oriented Programming - programming paradigm, based on objects (special kind of data structures with predefined operations) processing.
	 Object-oriented programming history starts from 1967 and during all the years there are 5 key principles crystalized:
	<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
		<li class="list-group-item" style="background-color: #d9dbf1;"><b>Everything is an object.</b> Object is a composite data structure storing data (attributes) and
			 having data processing algorithms (methods) letting manage data from inside of an object itself.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item" style="background-color: #d9dbf1;"><b>Program - is a whole of interconnected objects.</b> 
			Objects communicate with each other by calling each other's methods. Method call can be also treated as sending message.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item" style="background-color: #d9dbf1;"><b>Each object has allocated memory space in RAM.</b></li>
		<li class="list-group-item" style="background-color: #d9dbf1;"><b>Each object is an instance of some kind (type).</b> Type (class) defines 
			what kind of messages object will be able to receive and process.</li>
		<li class="list-group-item" style="background-color: #d9dbf1;"><b>All objects of the same origin can accept same messages.</b> 
			This principle is one of key principles and it will be discussed in chapter No. 5 <a href="oop.html?page=6">Inheritance</a> and chapter No. 6 <a href="oop.html?page=7">Polymorphism</a>.</li>
	</ul>
